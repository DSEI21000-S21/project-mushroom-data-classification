# Motivation
Mushrooms are the second largest group of organisms on the planet with a large capacity to populate through out every part of the world. Mushrooms are proven to have high 
nutritional importance and major health benefits. With the broad diversity of lineage that mushrooms comprise, it has been a challenge to accurately and precisely identify 
and classify mushrooms. Given their high value important properties and also risks assocaited with their poisonous traits, we believe that it is highly beneficial and i
mportant for the society and people doing various researches regarding this subject matter to be able to differnetialte mushroom classes and genes.
# Data Source
We used the Mushroom Data Set that we found from the open source UCL machine learning repository as a baseline to construct our models. The origin of this data set is constituted from  mushroom records drawn from *The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). G. H. Lincoff (Pres.), New York: Alfred A. Knopf*.
This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family and describes mushrooms in terms of their physical characterstics and classifies them as poisonous or edible.

# Objective
There has not been any clear rule that states the edibility of a mushroom out of the physical charactersics it pocess. So our mission is to try and find that pattern on the physical attributes of a mushroom to be able to classify the 23 genes within the Agaricus and Lepiota family found in the data set and also find the classification patterns for 
distinguishing as edible or poisonous. 
# Methods and Approaches
We're creating our own synthesized mushroom data set from the guide on North American Mushrooms to run our machine learning algorithms. We're implementing both supervised learning algorithm for classification purposes on edibile vs poisonous and unsupervised learning for the clustering tasks on the 23 genes of the Agaricus and Lepiota family. 
Some machine learning algorithms used for this project include knn, naive bayes, random forest regression, PCA and k-means clustering.
