    "While the original dataset contains enough information to train a model to classify samples into edibility, it is not enough to be used for species classification as the there is no species label. In order to label this dataset, we found it appropiate to use semi-supervised learning algorithms. Although the preferred option would be to label all 8124 samples, it would take an excessive amount of time and we might need the help of some experts are mushrooms are famous for being very hard to classify. We can make use of the fact that only samples of the Agaricus and Lepiota species were included in the data set, along with the access to the primary source of the dataset [2].\n",

    "\n",
    "    1. A species is selected\n",
    "    2. For each feature of this species, one of the possible categorical values for that given species is selected \n",

    "We must clarify that this algorithm cannot be used to assign a species label to a datapoint, instead it uses a species label to generate samples that could belong to that species. There is no way we can predict a species by inputting features without using machine learning or a similar concept. If we made a look up table we will certainly end up with more than one species being a perfectly good candidate for the datapoint, thus we need machinery that can make sense of more abstract data structures (Machine Learning).\n",

    "Unsupervised learning showed that there are some well defined clusters that make up our data set (Fig.x refer to 3PCA AND sillhouette diagram). Thus we can assume that the clusters correspond to a difference between some mushroom species, thus if we have enough clusters we may be able to find which clusters crorespond to each species. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning approaches would be the most efficient to make out clusters that have complex structures (a cluster within a cluster, overlapping clusters). But labeling over 8000 samples would be very time consuming for the scope of this project, and it would require the help of seasoned mycologists to classify mushroom species. Thus, purely supervised methods are not a valid option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-supervised algorithms allow us to learn from our unlabaled data by using a very small subset of labeled samples in combination to the structure of the data itself. Though, our data has to satisfy at least one of the following assupmtions [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Points that are close to each other are more likely to share a label: We are dealing with species, and members that belong to the same species (share a label) will have common traits (which make up the features on our dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data tend to form discrete clusters: As seen on the previous section, unsupervised learing managed to capture hidden structures on our data (clusters).\n",
    "\n",
    "scikit-learn offers two types of semi-supervised algorithms: [SelfTrainingClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.semi_supervised.SelfTrainingClassifier.html#sklearn.semi_supervised.SelfTrainingClassifier) and [LabelSpreading](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelSpreading.html#sklearn.semi_supervised.LabelSpreading). The self training classifier works by adapting a supervised scheme to function as a semi-supervised classifier by iteratively predicting pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and adding them to the training set until all dataset has been assigned a label. Unfortunately, this algorithm was not avaliable to use at the time of the making of this project (we tried using the source code but that didn't work) and it would be too time consuming to recreate it for the scope of this project. Thus, the only semi-supervised model we used was label spreading. \n",

    "2. **gamma (*float*):** This parameter adjusts the complexity of the rbf kernel, the higher the number the more complex the model but it might overfit, while a number too low will leave to high bias.\n",
    "3. **n_neighbors (*int*):** This parameter adjusts the behaviour of the knn kernel and complexity of the boundaries. \n",
    "4. **alpha (*float*):** A value between 0 and 1. A value of zero will keep the original labeled data as is, while a value of 1 will allow the model to change the orignal labels while velues in between will set a threshold for original label replacement.\n",

Each line represents the sulhouette score for a single datapoint, lines of the same color have the same labels. Scores range from -1 to 1.
